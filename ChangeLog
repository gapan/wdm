			none


26-Mar-2005 16:32  [wdm.1.27] patch by Thomas Glanzmann
			I don't think those changes was necessary, but if they
			make someone's life little better, why not apply it? :)
			It is said, that without these, wdm didn't work
			correctly on sunray servers


26-Mar-2005 14:26  [wdm.1.27] fix pam_open_session
			"I'm running wdm-1.27 on FreeBSD 5.2-CURRENT. Since
			version 1.26, PAM code seems not to work. ( This means
			that ssh-agent is not started even if pam_ssh.so is
			enabled. )

			I have checked src/wdm/session.c. If system has
			setusercontext(), I guess that pam_open_session() will
			never be called." Reported by Kan Sasaki
			<sasaki@fcc.ad.jp>


22-Mar-2005 21:09  [wdm.1.27] update aa code
			Antialiasing API has chaged in new wmaker. I need to
			update code. New code uses some #ifdefs. They should go
			away soon.


20-Mar-2005 16:46  [wdm.1.27] update config
			config file for aegis needs to be updated because
			create_symlinks_before_build field is obsolete. I need

			field.


19-Mar-2005 17:17  [wdm.1.27] fix fd leak - II
			Last descriptor leaked si return value of mkstemp
			function. I'm totally forgot, that this function
			returns value. Thanks Michael Gernoth for reminding me
			about it. :)


19-Mar-2005 13:31  [wdm.1.27] fix fd leak - I
			wdm leaks file descriptors to child processes. That's
			bad. This change fixed all leaked pipes and file
			descriptor for log. The only one left is leaked
			descriptor for removed auth file


09-Oct-2004 14:12  [wdm.1.27] Welsh translation
			Welsh translation sent to me by Kevin Donnelly
			<kevin@dotmon.com>


05-Oct-2004 21:53  [wdm.1.27] problem with xdmcp and ipv6
			Jennifer Elaan <jen@elaan.com> reported "that wdm drops
			the connection to the X server after login but before
			running Xsession.". Later she mailed me with "My
			partner just isolated and corrected this problem. The
			culprit is bad handling of IPv6 packets, which triggers
			a debug message with invalid arguments."


05-Oct-2004 21:49  [wdm.1.27] rebuild
			glibc was updated. I need rebuild

			found another warning while compiling on FreeBSD. "src/
			wdm/util.c:139: warning: implicit declaration of
			function `sigsetmask'." I don't see that on Linux.

			I simplified part dealing with signals. The setpgrp
			function differs on FreeBSD and Linux, but setpgid is
			not. I tested everything at least to compile on Linux
			and FreeBSD. I hope it will work on other BSD systems
			as well.


28-Feb-2004 13:28  [wdm.1.26] remove ExitLogin
			ExitLogin is generally not needed. There is new option
			to configure --enable-exitlogin for those who wants it.


23-Feb-2004 11:35  [wdm.1.26] make clean

			rebuild wiht simple make. including generated config
			files.


23-Feb-2004 11:18  [wdm.1.26] fix text in INSTALL file

			because of warnings: "src/wdm/resource.c:231: warning:
			dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-

22-Sep-2003 21:18  [wdm.1.26] fix debug compilation
			there's some calls to Debug left, can be reproduced
			with --enable-debug option specified to configure

			xdm sources from tarball.


13-Sep-2003 10:16  [wdm.1.25] fix pam rights escalation
			this bug and fix is from kdm. I don't know if it

			aafont option


05-Sep-2003 00:10  [wdm.1.25] fix daemon mode
			src/wdm/resource.c sets the debug value to 1 by
			default. It used to be 0 by default. This causes a
			problem in that a value of 1 prevents wdm from running
			as a daemon.  Line 140 of src/wdm/dm.c contains an if
			statement that only calls BecomeDaemon if debugLevel ==
			0. Reported by Noah Meyerhans <noahm@debian.org>

			build environment.

31-Aug-2003 19:24  [wdm.1.25] remove support for sysv streams
			sysv streams was never supported by wdm, there was
			never option to enable it. I cannot test this code
			because I dont't have access to OS wih streams. I

25-Apr-2003 22:31  [wdm.1.23] rewrite of configure.ac - I
			since I'm not supporting ancient versions of WINGs, I
			can remove a lot of steff from it. Rewrite started by

10-Mar-2003 14:36  [wdm.1.22] add debugging functions to libwdm
			I need some functions to provide debug info. I don't
